# static-exchange-rate

My class has just started teaching basic DOM operations. So I created this. I didn't care about performance. I just wanted to make it works.

## Description

The exchange rates are not dynamic ie no api calls. Conversion rates are calculated regarding 1 usd as a base currency.

> I've noticed that the original functionalities of this app is unintentionally confusing. So on the last commit, I've made major logic changes. When you select second base code for conversion rate changes, the app will change only second currency value based on the first.
