# static-exchange-rate
My class has just started teaching basic DOM operations. So I created this. I didn't care about performance. I just wanted to make it works.

## Description
The exchange rates are not dynamic ie no api calls. Conversion rates are calculated regarding 1 usd as a base currency.
